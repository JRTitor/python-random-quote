Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
So many books, so little time
A room without books is like a body without a soul
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
Be the change that you wish to see in the world
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much
Without music, life would be a mistake
Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again
It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then
The truth is rarely pure and never simple
The world is not a wish-granting factory
It's the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter
With great power... comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later
Death ends a life, not a relationship
Peace begins with a smile
All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream
Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary
Never memorize something that you can look up
